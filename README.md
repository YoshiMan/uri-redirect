# urlredirect
The app offers the possibility that an https link can point to any URL - for example to ms-excel:ofv|u|file:///C:/myfolder/important.xls. Some chat tools do not support highlighting of such links. One advantage of the app is that, for example, automatic messages - such as Remember to fill in the spreadsheet (link to an Excel spreadsheet on disk) - can be sent via a bot.
